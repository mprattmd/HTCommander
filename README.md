### Installation

Download the [MSI Installer](https://github.com/Ylianst/HTCommander/raw/refs/heads/main/releases/HTCommander-0.62.msi). Except for Open Street Map data, and checking for updates on GitHub, this tool does not sent data on the Internet. Pair your radio to your computer and run the application. If your computer does not have Bluetooth, you can get a inexpensive Bluetooth USB dongle. Make sure Bluetooth LE is supported. Pairing can be a bit tricky, you have to pair TWO Bluetooth devices in quick succession, [Bluetooth pairing instructions here](https://github.com/Ylianst/HTCommander/blob/main/docs/Paring.md).
